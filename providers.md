# Providers

By default Elephant doesn't actually provide any data to Walker. You can install any of these Elephant-Providers in order to "feed" Walker with the according information:

- `archlinuxpkgs`
- `bluetooth`
- `calc`
- `clipboard`
- `desktopapplications`
- `files`
- `menus`
- `nirisessions`
- `providerlist`
- `runner`
- `snippets`
- `symbols`
- `todo`
- `unicode`
- `websearch`
- `windows`
- `bookmarks`

This modular design allows you to only install what you want, without bloating up your system with other things.

By default, Walker provides many preconfigured prefixes for these providers out-of-the-box. Please refer to the default config.

## Configuration

Each provider has it's own documentation. You can get a complete configuration markdown file by running `elephant generatedoc`.

This will provide you with documentation for every provider you have installed.

## Elephant Community

Elephant has a [community repo](https://github.com/abenz1267/elephant-community).

Custom Menus from this repository can be installed via `elephant community`.
