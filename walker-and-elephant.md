# Walker and Elephant

Walker is a frontend program that allows you to interact with a backend: Elephant.

Elephant handles:

- what data should be shown
- how things are executed

Walker handles:

- deciding what is queried
- how to run actions

Therefore the overall Walker-Experience has to be configured for those two programs separately.
